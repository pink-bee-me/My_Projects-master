# HTML-iscious
HTML &amp; CSS Projects from The Tech Academy
This repository serves as a log of the assignments completed during my studies at The Tech Academy.
The purpose of the HTML-iscious Repository is to record, document, and provide a means to evaluate my progress as I find my way during this "Learning To Code" Journey.
