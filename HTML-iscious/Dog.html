					<p>I think that Quentin Tarantino hit on something BIG there !!!</p> 
					<p>Humor me for a minute, if you would please...</p>
					<p>	Would you agree that it is fair to say that "The Bowl" was created to facilitate the nourishment intake process. With the adaptation of serving pieces and eventually utensils too, the way in which man interacted and experienced his daily rations evolved. This adaptation changed the social and functional "norms" for the way people eat. Containment, delivery, and sanitation methods were greatly improved with the use of dishes, etc...</p>
	                <p>I hope we can agree on this line of thinking? Can I hear an "Amen"?...Good. Now, taking that a little further,I think it is fair to say that "The Bowl" is by far the most versitile of the serving tools...I think it's also worth mentioning, that whether the food be solid (maccaroni and cheese), liquid (Chicken Broth), or both (Beef Stew), the "bowl" really outshines the plate in both the catagory of function and design. The multi-fuctional aspect of "The Bowl", just makes "The Plate" dull in comparison. That being said, I feel pretty confident with my declaration:"If you or a loved one are ever in doubt when faced with a delimma about which type of dish to use in any given situation... without a doubt..."The BOWL" is definitely the way to go !!!"( and yes, You most certainly can quote me on that...please do!) You never know, you might find yourself faced with making such a choice--plate or bowl ?...It is best for one to be prepared for such an occasion. So, which will you choose??? -- It could happen!...Now I've gone and forgot what I was talking about. Goodness gracious. Oh yes, the point is bowls are for eating and drinking,... and usually we serve our pets their food and water, each in a bowl. Agreed? Agreed.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Now,with all of that tactical stuff clarifid and out of the way...I can move forward with my story. Thank Goodness for that!</p>
					<p>Back to my story...Soooooo, I must admit that I couldn't help but find it somewhat peculiar - the sight I stumbled upon that chilly October morning. You know, the kind of morning that you have a little frost on your windsheild. The sun bounces off the dew and thin ice crystals that have formed on the grass and chainlink fence. The reflecting sparkles from the ice crystals mix with the mysterious plume of smoke that rises into the air with each breath. Beautiful and serene, also slightly blinding...You know the kind I'm talking about. Well, as I am headed to the car to turn on the heater and start the defoster to begin the windsheild meltdown process, I turn to say good morning to Li'l Bit and this is what I saw...</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Let's take a look at Exhibit "A"</p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
				<h2>Exhibit "A"</h2>		
						
						<img src="https://pink-me-pleez.neocities.org/ButtInBowl.jpg">
					<p></p>
					<p>...Just in case anyone is unsure of what is going on in the photo above, I will clarify.</p>
					<p>We are looking at my dog, Li'l Bit. Li'l Bit does not care for the brisk air and the sparkles that mark the change of season. He simply does not love it. However, he does love destroying water bowls.</p>
					<p>So when my dad brought home a brand new water bowl made out of a black rubber type of material to replace the tupperware water bowl that Li'l Bit had eaten the day before, I was grateful, very grateful.</p>
					<p>Everyone knows how important it is for a dog to have water to drink. It ranks pretty high on the scale of necessary items required for the continuance of life and such.</p>
					<p>Well, it turns out that Li'l Bit really does NOT like to have to set his precious bare bottom on the concrete until it has been sufficiently warmed by the sun.</p>
					<p>As you can see in the photo (Exhibit "A"), Li'l Bit has long since dumped the water out of his nice and roomy, new bowl. He has opted to repurpose his brand new bowl into a seat cushion. So there he sits, with his back to me as if I have traumatized him by leaving him outside with no proper seating area. I tried to explain to him that the bowl is designed to hold his water and not to sit in, but he will hear nothing of it. No sir.</p>
					<p> As far as Li'l Bit is concerned, a cold bottom is no good. He would rather go without water than sit on the cold concrete. He simply refuses to subject himself to those intolerable conditions.</p>
					<p> Li'l Bit turns five this next year, in February. He is about nine months old in that photo...and he has been sitting in bowls ever since that chilly October morning!!! He looks so funny sometimes - sitting in a little bowl that doesn't quite meet the area requirements of his bottom measurement. Actually, I'm proud of my Li'l Bit for using his critical thinking skills to find a solution to his problem. Job well done, Boy ! I will have to agree with Li'l Bit on this one for sure,"A Cold Bottom Is Never A Good Thing,...And That, Most Certainly, Is A Fact."</p>
