			<p></p>
			<p>Waking up in morning, sitting down with your fresh cup of coffee, and looking out your window at your
				plush green lawn that is shimmering as the sunlight bounces off the morning dew. Yoy know the kind of
				lawn I'm talking about. The kind of lawn that makes you want to go barefoot. The kind of lawn that
				beckons you to roll around and wrestle with your kiddos, play fetch the ball with your dog, or just
				relax and lie on your back and watch the clouds go by or gaze at the stars!!!</p>
			<p>If that sort of thing sounds good to you...Check out the LawnCare Calculator by navigating to the Home
				section at the top of this page.</p>
