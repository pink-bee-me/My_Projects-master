			<h3>Inspiration...</h3>
			<p>
				Isn't that true?<br>
				Let's agree -- Francis Bacon knew what he was talking about!<br>
				A beautiful lawn comforts our spirit and brings us joy...<br>
				There is nothing quite like the smell of fresh cut grass...listening to song birds at daybreak, and
				sipping fresh coffee while<br>
				you watching as the sunrise sets the lawn a-blaze with diamond-like sparkles as the first rays of light
				begin to bounce off the morning dew...<br>

			<h3>Motivation...</h3>

			<p>
				Have YOU ever had a lawn so plush, that it turned your neighbors into "so-called" haters ???<br>
				...if that sounds like the kind of problem you could get used to -- Then the time has come to Step-Up
				Your Game!!!<br>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Make A Plan...</h3>
			<p>
				It's easy to turn that lack-luster lawn into the eye-catching home enhancement it was always meant to
				be.<br>
				All you need is a calculated plan and a little bit of discipline to insure a high yield return on your
				investment.<br><br>

				<span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold;">The LawnCare Calculator</span> is here to help you make
				that plan.
			</p>
		</section>


		<section>
			<h3>Confidence is Key...</h3>
			<p>
				Figuring out the proper fertilization ratio can be tricky ...<br>
				Wouldn't it be nice to completely eliminate all of the "guess-work"? <br>
				Wouldn't it be nice to be confident that your lawn fertilization equation has been calculated
				correctly?<br>
				We thought so too!<br><br>

				So,...Say "GoodBye" to the confusing calculations and the sub-par results of yester-year...<br>
				and say "HELLO !" to <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold;">The LawnCare Calculator</span>.<br>
