			<h1>Let's look at some examples of the DIV and Style Element in use:</h1>
			<p>For the heading color to be magenta, I used the style tag. I specified that the color change only be applied to the Heading (h1)tag by using the "div"tag. If I hadn't used the "div" tag to separate the heading section from the rest of the document the text for the whole document would be presented in the color of magenta.
		
			<p>This section shows DIV or Style tags being used to enhance this paragraph in multiple ways:</p>
			<p></p>
		
			<p>First:</p>
			<p>The color of the text is changed to GREEN.</p>
			<p>Second: The word</p> 
			<p class="de_la_LSue_1">GREEN</p>
			<p>is clearly set to bold print.</p>
			<p>Third:</p>
			<p class="de_la_LSue_2">This sentence will be set to print in italic.</p> 
			<p>Fourth:</p>
			<p>And for the Grand Finale let's underline AND bold....</p>
			<p class="de_la_LSue_3";class="de_la_LSue_1">"The End!!!"</p>
			<p>The <b>Bold</b>, <i>Italic</i>, and <u>Underlined</u> text are achieved by using the appropriate "attribute" (b,i,u) within the paragraph tag you wish the enhancement to be used.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>NOTE:The First, Second, Third, and Fourth example were first completed with tags ad then converted via class attribute within the HTML style element. BUT the last sentence with Bold And Italic And Underlined mentioned is accomplished with the (b,i,u) attrinute respectively.</p>
		<h2>--Best Practice means Using CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)--</h2>
		<h3> There are many benefits to using CSS3.</h3>
		<h5>Web Developers use CSS3, the current version of Cascading Style Sheets, to create a master style sheet that can be applied to all the web pages within any web design project. Utilizing one main style sheet to implement a consistent style to all of the html pages with in a project(website) provides two main benefits: </h5>
		<h5>First, if there are improvements to be made or bugs to be fixed, you only need to make the change to one document (the CSS style sheet) and all pages on the site will reflect the change as well.</h5>
		<h5>Second, the fluidity that is created by applying the same style to all of the pages with in a project "pulls everything together". This helps to ensure a visualy pleasing experience for the user. Also, as a result of the consistent stlying, connection between the HTML pages is re-inforced and strengthened creating a cohesive presentation of information.</h5>
		<h4>The main "take-away" here is: Not only is using CSS3 considered "Best Practice";...It is also true that utilizing cascading style sheets (CSS3) in your workflow is the most efficient way to apply aesthetic code to your web projects.</h4>
